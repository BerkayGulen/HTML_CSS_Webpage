                        <h3>HISTORY OF HTML</h3>
                        <p>HTML was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991 but was not released officially,
                            published in 1995 as HTML 2.0. HTML 4.01 was published in late 1999 and was a major version
                            of HTML.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>HTML is a very evolving markup language and has evolved with various versions updating. Long
                            before its revised standards and specifications are carried in, each version has allowed its
                            user to create web pages in a much easier and prettier way and make sites very efficient.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li><em>HTML 1.0</em> was released in <em>1993</em> with the intention of sharing
                                information that can be readable and accessible via web browsers. But not many of the
                                developers were involved in creating websites. So the language was also not growing.
                            </li>
                            <li>Then comes the <em>HTML 2.0</em>, published in <em>1995</em>, which contains all the
                                features of HTML 1.0 along with that few additional features, which remained as the
                                standard markup language for designing and creating websites until January 1997 and
                                refined various core features of HTML.</li>
                            <li>Then comes the <em>HTML 3.0</em>, where <em>Dave Raggett</em> who introduced a fresh
                                paper or draft on HTML. It included improved new features of HTML, giving more powerful
                                characteristics for webmasters in designing web pages. But these powerful features of
                                new HTML slowed down the browser in applying further improvements.</li>
                            <li>Then comes <em>HTML 4.01,</em> which is widely used and was a successful version of HTML
                                before <em>HTML 5.0</em>, which is currently released and used worldwide. HTML 5 can be
                                said for an extended version of HTML 4.01, which was published in the year
                                <em>2012</em>.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="history-css">
                        <h3>HISTORY OF CSS</h3>
                        <p>CSS was first proposed by Håkon Wium Lie on October 10, 1994. At the time, Lie was working
                            with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN. Several other style sheet languages for the web were proposed
                            around the same time, and discussions on public mailing lists and inside World Wide Web
                            Consortium resulted in the first W3C CSS Recommendation (CSS1) being released in 1996. In
                            particular, a proposal by Bert Bos was influential; he became co-author of CSS1, and is
                            regarded as co-creator of CSS.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Style sheets have existed in one form or another since the beginnings of Standard Generalized
                            Markup Language (SGML) in the 1980s, and CSS was developed to provide style sheets for the
                            web.[26] One requirement for a web style sheet language was for style sheets to come from
                            different sources on the web. Therefore, existing style sheet languages like DSSSL and FOSI
                            were not suitable. CSS, on the other hand, let a document's style be influenced by multiple
                            style sheets by way of "cascading" styles.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>CSS comes in different versions. CSS level 1 was released in 1996, and republished with
                            corections in 1999. CSS level 2 appeared in 1998 and built on CSS level 1. CSS level 2 adds
                            support for different output media. CSS 3 is currently in development and will be split up
                            in modules.</p>
